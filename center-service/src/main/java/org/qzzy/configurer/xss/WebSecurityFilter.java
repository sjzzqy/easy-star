     * 1. Examine the request<br>

     * filter content or headers for input filtering <br>
     * 3. Optionally wrap the response object with a custom implementation to
     * filter content or headers for output filtering <br>
     * 4. a) <strong>Either</strong> invoke the next entity in the chain using
     * the FilterChain object (<code>chain.doFilter()</code>), <br>
     * 4. b) <strong>or</strong> not pass on the request/response pair to the
     * next entity in the filter chain to block the request processing<br>
     * 5. Directly set headers on the response after invocation of the next
     * entity in the filter chain.

     * @param request  The request to process
     * @param response The response associated with the request
     * @param chain    Provides access to the next filter in the chain for this
